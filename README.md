# React 19 useEffect Hook Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered with the `useEffect` hook in React 19, specifically unexpected re-renders or infinite loops. The problem arises when the component re-renders even though the dependencies array is correctly specified.

## Problem
The `useEffect` hook is supposed to only run when the values in its dependency array change. However, in certain cases, it might trigger re-renders unintentionally, causing performance issues or infinite loops.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully examining the dependencies array and ensuring that it includes all values that the effect relies upon.  In some cases, optimizing state updates or using functional updates for state can resolve the issue.  Also, ensure you understand the subtleties of React's rendering process and how state changes trigger updates.
